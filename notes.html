<h1><u>KEY CONCEPTS</u></h1>

<div>
  <h2>Lesson 1: Basics of HTML</h2>

  <div>
    <p>
      <h3>WHAT IS THE WEB</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      Major pieces of the web include: me, my computer/browser, the internet, and servers. Each component interacts
      to result in the experience we've become accustomed to: I open a browser, type the URL "google.com" and HTTP
      sends a request to the appropriate server. That server then responds by delivering the requested HTML file back
      to the requester.<br>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <h3>HTML</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language - is a file-type availabe for use on the web - the most prevalent file-type, in fact. It's the heart-beat of the web.
      HTML can be text content, markup, references to other docs, or links to other pages.

    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <h3>HTML MARKUP</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Markup" is how we edit HTML. It's made up of and uses "tags".
      <xmp> <tag> "content" </tag> </xmp> The above represents an <em>element</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>EXAMPLES OF TAGS</em><br>

      <xmp><a> = anchor (inline tag)</xmp>
      <xmp><p> = paragraph (block tag)</xmp>
      <xmp><div> = block tag that allows for styling</xmp>
      <xmp><span> = inline tag (similar to div, but inline)</xmp>
      <xmp><b> = bold (inline tag)</xmp>
      <xmp><strong> = similar to bold</xmp>
      <xmp><form> = block tag</xmp>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>LINKING</em>
    </p>
    <p> "href" tag is for linking (means hypertext reference)<br>
        example: <xmp><a href="www.espn.com"> SPORTS NEWS! </a></xmp>
        NOTE: don't forget the quotation marks!<br>
        EXAMPLE IN ACTION:<a href="www.espn.com"> SPORTS NEWS! </a><br><br>
        Images are linked using "src" tag. See w3schools.com for more when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>INLINE VS. BLOCK TAGS</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Inline tags and block tags act differently<br>
      Inline tags: act simply<br>
      Block tags: have height and width. Literally form a box around the text/etc
    </p>

  </div>

    <p>
      <h3>HTML DOCUMENT STRUCTURE</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML docs begin with ""!doctype" (simply "HTML" in most cases)<br>
      then head closed by "/head" - includes metadata, css, and page header/title info<br>
      then body closed by "/body" - all of the main contents of the document/page
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:<br>
       <xmp><!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
              <title>Document title</title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <h1>Page title</h1>
              <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
              </p>
            </body>
            </html></xmp>
    </p>

NOTE: Code in a way that is easily read by others. Document well. Use tabs.<br><br>


Forget something? Google it or go to w3schools.com (lots of great documentation)

    <h2>Lesson 2: HTML AND PAGE STRUCTURE</h2>

  <div>
    <p>
      <h3>PAGE STRUCTURE</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML and CSS are both "languages". HTML controls the "structure" of a
      web page while CSS controls the "style" of a page - how it looks.
      "DOM" (Document Object Model) is the tree-like structure of a page,
      as viewed through the 'developer tools' offered within Chrome, for example.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>BOXIFYING</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
      First, it's worth noting that 'boxifying' is a real word - def would've
      lost that bet, but now I'll win Scrabble.<br><br>
      Basically, everything we see on a webpage is comprised of a group/series
      of boxes. Within these boxes the 'magic' is happening - HTML and CSS are
      working together to generate a visual output we like.<br><br>
      Developers 'boxify' design copy in order to simplify HTML development
      and administration.
