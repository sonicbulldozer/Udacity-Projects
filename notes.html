<h1><u>Lesson 1 Key Concepts</u></h1>

<h2>WHAT IS THE WEB</h2>
Major pieces of the web include:<br>
me, my computer/browser, the internet, and servers<br>
HTML is a file-type availabe for use on the web...the most prevalent file-type<br><br>

<h2>HTML</h2>
web = collection of HTML docs (Hyper Text Markup Language)<br> HTML = basis for every web page<br>
hyper-links ("links") is what makes the web...web-like<br>
HTML = the heart of the web<br>
It can be: text content, markup, references to other docs, links to other pages<br><br>

<h2>HTML MARKUP</h2>

"markup" is how we edit HTML<br>
it's made up of and uses "tags"<br>
tag "content" /tag = element.
an "element is the entire string "<br><br>

<b>EXAMPLES OF TAGS</b><br>
(note that tags use brackets "<>")<br>
a = anchor (inline tag)<br>
p = paragraph (block tag)<br>
div = block tag that allows for styling <br>
span = inline tag (similar to div, but inline)<br>
b = bold (inline tag)<br>
strong = similar to bold<br>
form = block tag<br><br>

<h2>LINKING</h2>
href tag is for linking (means hypertext reference)<br>
example: a href="www.espn.com"> SPORTS NEWS! /a <br>
NOTE: don't forget the quotation marks!<br>
EXAMPLE IN ACTION:<a href="www.espn.com"> SPORTS NEWS! </a><br><br>

<h2>INLINE VS. BLOCK TAGS</h2>
Inline tags and block tags act differently<br>
Inline tags: act simply<br>
Block tags: have height and width. literally form a box around the text/etc<br><br>


<h2>HTML DOCUMENT STRUCTURE</h2>
begins with !doctype (simply "HTML" in most cases)<br>
then head closed by /head - includes metadata, css, and page header/title info<br>
then body closed by /body - all of the main contents of the document/page<br><br>

NOTE: Code in a way that is easily read by others. Document well. Use tabs.<br><br>
